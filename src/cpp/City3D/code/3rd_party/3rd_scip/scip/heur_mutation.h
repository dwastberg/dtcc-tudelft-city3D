 * @brief  LNS heuristic that tries to randomly mutate the incumbent solution
 * @author Timo Berthold
 *
 * Mutation is a large neighborhood search improvement heuristic that is inspired by genetic algorithms and requires a
 * known feasible solution. It randomly fixes variables to their value in the incumbent solution and solves a sub-SCIP,
 * consisting of the remaining variables. See also @ref heur_crossover.h
